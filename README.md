# Basic_ETL_pipeline

Basic ETL pipeline Dag files using Apache Airflow written in Python.

I have created this repository as a part of my course that I have completed on LinkedIn Learning.

The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/hands-on-introduction-data-engineering?dApp=59033956&leis=LAA).

**Note:** The dataset I have used for this repository is the "top-level-domain-names" from https://datahub.io/core/top-level-domain-names.Although, we are going to extract this dataset through dag file, but I have uploaded the dataset file in the repository.Just in case.ðŸ˜Š
